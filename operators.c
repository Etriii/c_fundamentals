/* 
Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

Example
int myNum = 100 + 50;



Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:

Example
int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)
*/ 

/* 
C divides the operators into the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Bitwise operators
*/ 


/*
Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operator	Name	        Description	                            Example
+	        Addition	    Adds together two values    	        x + y	
-	        Subtraction	    Subtracts one value from another	    x - y	
*	        Multiplication	Multiplies two values           	    x * y	
/	        Division	    Divides one value by another	        x / y	
%	        Modulus	        Returns the division remainder  	    x % y	
++	        Increment	    Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
--	        Decrement	    Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x	
*/ 


/*
Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x:

Example
int x = 10;

A list of all assignment operators:

Operator	Example	    Same As	Try it
=	        x = 5	    x = 5	
+=	        x += 3	    x = x + 3	
-=	        x -= 3	    x = x - 3	
*=      	x *= 3	    x = x * 3	
/=      	x /= 3	    x = x / 3	
%=	        x %= 3	    x = x % 3	
&=	        x &= 3  	x = x & 3	
|=      	x |= 3	    x = x | 3	
^=	        x ^= 3	    x = x ^ 3	
>>=	        x >>= 3	    x = x >> 3	
<<=	        x <<= 3	    x = x << 3
